## Lesson Target

To successfully create the infrastructure so that my Google Doc template would publish.

## Did I reach my target?

 In my opinion, yes. This is because I followed all nescessary steps and even took my work home, using different templates and editing options.

## How did I learn? What strategies were effective? 

Mainly by focused listening and watching a demonstration.

## What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? 

The first set of instructions went well, although I managed to get confused when the program showed up a slightly different version of the information and I got distracted by menus that weren’t relevant.  


This made me change my ways and I decided to take quick notes (on paper) so that I could remember the instructions in the correct order next time.  This strategy helped me a lot, and the next process went really smoothly.

## What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?

Always be ready to make notes so that I don’t forget, and I can work better independently when things go a bit wrong...
